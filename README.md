# surfs_up
Climate Analysis with SQL, SQLite, SQLAlchemy and FLASK

## Challenge
Findings : Overall June looks like s better month to launch the business. One reason is because the average precipiation is less, and in addition to that, the standard deviation of rainfall is less as well as lower precipitation amounts in the percentile analysis. The max rainfall is also less in June, and finally, the temperature is just slightly warmer with less standard deviation, which could promote ice cream sales initially leading to better customer retention.

Further analysis could include wind speeds and tide movement which would be good indicators for surfing conditions. It would also be good to monitor tourism trends in the area as Hawaii relies heavily on tourism and W. Avys's business would as well.
